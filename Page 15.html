<h1 id="headings">Going Alone</h1>
	<p id="body">You spend the next few months working your townspeople, and going over the plan over and over. Everything goes very smoothly. The night before the attack, you are finalizing the battle plan with your second-in-command. One of you needs to be out front, in the towers, coordinating the soldiers attacking from the highest points, while the other needs to lead the second wave of soldiers who attack the dragons once they are grounded. As the highest ranking knight in the army, it is your choice as to which part of the battle you will lead. The fate of Portlandia depends upon your choice.</p>
