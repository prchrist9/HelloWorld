	<p id="body">You spend the next few months working with the town of Leon, and enlisting their help with your plan. Everything goes about as well as you could have hoped for. The night before the attack, you are finalizing the battle plan with the knight in charge of Leon's defenses. One of you needs to be out front, in the towers, coordinating the soldiers attacking the dragons, while the other knight needs to lead the second wave of soldiers who attack the dragons once they are are on the ground. As the highest ranking knight in the army, it is your choice as to which part of the battle you will lead. The fate of Portlandia, and Leon, depend upon your choice.<br><br></p>

	<h5 id="choice">I decided to use archery instead of a trap.</h5>
	<h5 id="choice">I combined forces with Leon.</h5>
