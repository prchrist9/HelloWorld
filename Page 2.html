	<h1 class="headings">Speaking to the Villagers</h1>
	<p class="body">After talking to the villagers, you get a sense of what life is like in Portlandia. They are simple, hard working people, but very kind. They live primarily off fishing and hunting from the nearby river. They have a way of lowering your defenses, and making you feel right at home. After a month of living in "y", you realize how much you care about the villagers.<br><br></p>
	<p class="body">Your time with the villagers has made you realize that there are two plans of action for dealing with "z". The first is to train the town's milita in archery, and to try and bring down "z" through that method. The second is to use Portlandia's natural defenses, and build a trap for "z". You think that by building a moat, you can trap "z" in the moat, and defeat her using brains instead of brawn. "x", what is your choice?<br><br></p>
