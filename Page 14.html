<h1 id="headings">Getting Help</h1>
	<p id="body">You spend the next few months working with the town of Leon, and enlisting their help with your plan. Everything goes very smoothly. The night before the attack, you are finalizing the battle plan with the knight in charge of Leon's defenses. One of you needs to be out front, in the towers, coordinating the soldiers first attack, while the other knight needs to lead the second wave of soldiers who attack the dragons once they are grounded. As the highest ranking knight in the army, it is your choice as to which part of the battle you will lead. The fate of Portlandia, and Leon, depend upon your choice.<br><br></p>
