	<h1 class="headings">The Land</h1>
	<p class="body">Portlandia has amazing natural beauty. It is surrounded by plains, but the nearby river is what allows the villagers to thrive. It brings a ton of fish and animals to the area, allowing the citizens of Portlandia to survive and thrive by fishing, hunting, and gathering, and using their skills to trade with travelers.<br><br></p>
	<p class="body">Your time spent surveying the land has made you realize that there are two plans of action for dealing with "z". The first is to train the town's milita in archery, and to try and bring down "z" through that method. The second is to use Portlandia's natural defenses, and build a trap for "z". You think that by building a moat, you can trap "z" in the moat, and defeat her using brains instead of brawn. "x", what is your choice?<br><br></p>
