	<p id="body">You spend the next few months working your townspeople, and going over the plan over and over. Everything goes very smoothly. The night before the attack, you are finalizing the battle plan with your second-in-command. One of you needs to be out front, in the trap, coordinating the soldiers from the towers, while the other needs to lead the second wave who attack the dragons once they are grounded. As the highest ranking knight in the army, it is your choice as to which part of the battle you will lead. The fate of Portlandia depends upon your choice.</p>
