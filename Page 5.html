	<h1 class='headings'>Bring Down The Sky</h1>
	<p class='body'>After three months, you beleive that you have taught the people of Portlandia everything you can about archery. There were more than a few hiccups, and progress was often slow, but you certainly feel better about your chances of surviving "z"'s attack than you dclass when you first arrived. While you were teaching the milita about archery, construction workers were building towers and turrets for the archers to shoot from. The plan is to to attack "z" from the sky, and weaken her before she lands in the town. Once she is grounded, and weakened, you believe that you will be able to defeat her easily.<br><br></p>
	
	<p class='body'> As you are planning your next move, a messenger comes with an urgent message from the queen. She has learned that a second dragon, "h", is going to attack the nearby town of Leon at the same time as "z" attacks Portlandia. She also has reason to believe that "h" and "z" have no knowledge of each other. She believes that if you offered to help Leon, you could combine your forces, but that the dragons would quickly realize what was happening and also combine forces. If you chose not to enlist the help of Leon, then you would only have to worry about protecting Portlandia from "z". The queen believes that Leon can defeat "h" on their own, as she has sent another knight to help them, in the same way that you have been helping Portlandia. The queen expects your response immediately.<br><br></p>

	<h3 class="previous">Previous Choices</h3>
	<h5 class="choice">I spoke with the villagers instead of surveying the land.</h5>
	<h5 class="choice">I decclassed to teach the villagers archery instead of building a trap.</h5>

	<button class="button"onclick="window.location.href='Page 10.html'">I will combine my forces with Leon, and fight "z" and "h" together.</button>
	<button class="button"onclick="window.location.href='Page 11.html'">Fighting two dragons is too risky-Leon can take care of "h", and we will focus on "z".</button>
