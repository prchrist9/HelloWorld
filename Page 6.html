	<p class='body'>"This....this could work"<br><br></p>
	<p class='body'>You grimace and nod your head. After three months of hard work, you have finished laying the physical groundwork for the trap. After surveying the land, you realized that the river was the key to everything. Without it, Portlandia wouldn't be a thriving community. After discussions, you realized that the best way to trap "z" was to build a fake connecting stream to the river. The idea is that "z" would be atttracted to such a seemingly important structure, and attack that first. By "encouraging" "z" to attack a certain area, you realized that you could gain the upper hand, and use that knowledge to plan an immediate, and hopefully effective, counterattck. However, progress was slow on building the trap. It rained constantly, and by the time you had finsihed, you had to redo several parts. Overall, things could have gone better.<br><br></p>

	<p class='body'> As you are planning your next move, a messenger comes with an urgent message from the queen. She has learned that a second dragon, "h", is going to attack the nearby town of Leon at the same time as "z" attacks Portlandia. She also has reason to believe that "h" and "z" have no knowledge of each other. She believes that if you offered to help Leon, you could combine your forces, but that the dragons would quickly realize what was happening and also combine forces. If you chose not to enlist the help of Leon, then you would only have to worry about protecting Portlandia from "z". The queen believes that Leon can defeat "h" on their own, as she has sent another knight to help them, in the same way that you have been helping Portlandia. The queen expects your response immediately.<br><br></p>

	<button class="button"onclick="window.location.href='Page 13.html'">Fighting two dragons is too risky-Leon can take care of "h", and we will focus on "z".</button>
